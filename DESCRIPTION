Description: Traditional variant calling methods utilize variant allele frequency (VAF) cutoffs
	to call variants. These cutoffs are often set arbitrarily and the measure becomes 
	problematic when trying to call at variants at low VAFs, where true biological variation 
	becomes hard to distinguish from sequencing error. The 'Espresso' package employs a novel 
	variant calling approach that models sequencing error distributions across 192 trinucleotide 
	contexts and conducts variant calling by comparing each putative variant to its corresponding
	contextual error distribution. This demonstrates superior sensitivity and specificity over 
	existing variant calling methods and bolsters our ability to accurately distinguish signal 
	from noise at very low VAFs.
