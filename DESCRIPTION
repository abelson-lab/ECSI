Description: Traditional variant calling methods utilize variant allele frequency (VAF) cutoffs
  to call variants. These cutoffs are often set arbitrarily and the measure becomes 
  problematic when trying to call at variants at low VAFs, where true biological variation 
  becomes hard to distinguish from sequencing error. The 'ECSI' package employs a novel 
  variant calling approach that models sequencing error distributions across 192 trinucleotide 
  contexts and conducts variant calling by comparing each putative variant to its corresponding
  contextual error distribution. This demonstrates superior sensitivity and specificity over 
  existing variant calling methods and bolsters our ability to accurately distinguish signal 
  from noise at very low VAFs.
